**SQL Skills Used:** 

Data Retrieval (SELECT): Queried and extracted specific information from the database.

Data Aggregation (SUM, COUNT, AVG): Calculated totals, averages, such as incident types and cost, and counted records to analyze data trends.

Data Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, AND): Applied filters to select relevant data, including filtering by ranges and lists.

Data Grouping (GROUP BY) Grouped rows of data with identical values into summary group.

Data Sorting (ORDER BY) Sort the queried in ascending and descending order.

Data Source Specification (FROM): Specified the tables used as data sources for retrieval.

**Project Description:** 

This project aims to assess the workplace safety data of a US company to identify incident details, hazards, costs, and general risk assessment to prevent future occurrences.  A comprehensive report focusing on specific information, such as incidents by each plant, costs by department, distribution of incident type, and many more were created using various SQL queries.
